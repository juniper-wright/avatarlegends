# Avatar Legends

A simple, unofficial [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) system for [Magpie Games](https://magpiegames.com/)' [Avatar Legends: The RPG](https://magpiegames.com/pages/avatarrpg).

## Installation

There are two ways to install this package:

* From your Foundry VTT instance's config panel:
    * Navigate to "Game Systems"
    * Click "Install System"
    * Paste this repo's manifest url in the "Manifest URL" field: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juniper-wright/avatarlegends/main/system.json`
    * Click "Install"!
* As a zip file:
    * Choose a specific [release](https://github.com/ian-mcdevitt/avatarlegends/releases) from the repository
    * Download the associated zip file
    * Unzip that file into your Foundry VTT instance's `/Data/systems` directory

If you installed a version prior to v1.0.0, update at your own risk; much of the Actor and Item functionality was in flux up until that version.

## Overview

This system is released under the MIT license described in [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt), and its copyright belongs to its contributors.

Forked from the [Monster of the Week System](https://gitlab.com/3cell/monsterweek.git).

## Changes I'd like to make:

* Add a way to roll with an NPC's principle
* Have moves' miss/weakhit/stronghit rules show up in chat
* A way to track, interact with, or include playbook features
* Add a "taken out" indicator if fatigue and conditions are maxed
* Actual fields for forward/ongoing (with scope levels: all, stat, move, etc)
* Moves should have fields for basic/balance/playbook/game-system, which playbook it belongs to if playbook

## Versioning:

* This package uses [semver](https://semver.org/).
